# Ubuntu Init
My personal set of scripts to setup a new Ubuntu machine with the settings and applications I use. This isn't a production ready script as it will likely contain a lot of bloat.

These include the following:
* Update the system
* Install PostgreSQL
* Install Docker
* Install Docker Compose
* Install AWS CLI
* Node JS
